# Guidelines for files in the include folder

- A file with a SQL request should be named in uppercase with the sql extension. The first part of the name must be what the SQL request does such as CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
**Good Example:**
```
CREATE_MY_REQUEST.sql
```
**Bad Example:**
```
my_request.txt
```
